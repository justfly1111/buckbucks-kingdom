Dkron is a system service for workload automation that runs scheduled
jobs, just like the cron unix service but distributed in several
machines in a cluster. It has no single point of failure, a
comprehensive API, and an easy to use dashboard.

By default it requires 3 ports:

- 8946 for serf layer between agents
- 8080 for HTTP for the API and Dashboard
- 6868 for gRPC and raft layer comunication between agents.

You can give dkron a test run on a single node with:

    dkron agent --server --bootstrap-expect=1
